# Linux improvement scripts
_There are few scripts which i have made for my own Ubuntu-based linux (Mint, Ubuntu) to improve my feel_

`touchpad_gestures_configuration.sh`

I have made this script for introduce Windows 10- like touchpad gestures to linux:

1) If you swipe up with three fingers you will see all opened programs like if you click Ctrl+F9
2) If you swipe right with three fingers you will go to next virtual desktop
3) If you swipe left with three fingers you will go to previous virtual desktop

P.S You need to get to System Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Global Shortcuts -> System Preferences 
and set "Switch to next desktop" shortcut to Ctrl+Super+Right and "Switch to next desktop" shortcut to Ctrl+Super+Left
